<u><h1> What Joe did. </h1></u>

<p> I was at home on a hot summer day in winter and playing a game called Overwatch. I also spent time with my friends we walked around town doing whatever. My family got together on chirstmas eve and played fun games and had a big dinner together. the rest of my break was ranking up in overwatch.</p>

<p>What are you guys playing?

I'm supposed to be playing Game Of War™ but this one player keeps kicking my ass.

Is it TheLegend27?!

Yeah, TheLegend27.

Who is the legend 27?</p>

<p>Some say TheLegend27 is the first Game Of War™ player ever.

Born from fire.

I heard, TheLegend27 can hurl a boulder farther than a catapult.

I heard TheLegend27 once defeated an entire army with a single blow.

But the worst part is, just when you think you're safe, just when you think you might escape...

WHAM!!! Just like that! </p>
