<u><h1> What Joe did. </h1></u>

<p> I was at home on a hot summer day in winter and playing a game called Overwatch. I have no friends or life so i just stayed home all winter break and play games or watch tv with my family. I mostly played overwatch.</p>

<p> During christmas eve my family went to my cousins house to have a big family dinner with my cousins and my grandparents. It was fun we played games and laughed amd had fun. On Christmas day I just got money because my family doesn't do the whole "christmas experience". </p>
